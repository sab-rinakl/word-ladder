# word-ladder
Word ladder program in C++ that uses a custom templated minheap and the A* search algorithm to find the shortest chain between two words, given a basic dictionary. 
The dictionary used in this project was created at https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_alpha.txt and is supplied in the dictionary.txt file. 
To use the program, the user inputs the two words they want to find the shortest disctance between on the command line. 
Outputs are in all caps.
